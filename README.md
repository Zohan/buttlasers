# ButtLasers
Accelerometer LED Panties

# No seriously, what's wrong with you?
In the Summer of 2015, some drinking at a music show led to a discussion about putting leds and lasers on a pair of underwear.
A bunch of us had a good laugh. Then I went home and built it. Who's laughing now? Turns out the entire audience.
Lasers not recommended for safety reasons, but hey, it's your underoos.

# Alright I want to join the Twerk Team
Great! Everything can be purchased off Adafruit. Here's the parts list:
1x Microcontroller. A Adafruit Gemma can barely fit the LSM303 code. An Arudino Pro Mini can fit the 9-DOF code with room left over.
1x Accelerometer. The code provided is for the Flora LSM303 or Flora 9-DOF.
4x Flora RGB Smart Neopixels
1x Adafruit Micro LiPo Charger
1x Conductive Thread Ribbon Cable (The original buttlasers used the now-discontinued 4-Channel Fabric Ribbon)
1x Pair of underwear or bicycle shorts
Some fabric to create a small pouch with
A needle and some thread

It is recommended that you AVOID the unshielded steel/conductive threads available on Adafruit for this project, and remove as little of the conductive thread's fabric as possible to minimize crossed wires/shorts (Ouch!)

Pictures are enclosed of how the sewing works, The parts are centered when worn though they look off in the photo. Your intimates may differ, place the components with a mannueqin or someone wearing them.

For the Pro Mini: LED Pin is 7, Accelerometer is A4 (SDA) and A5 (SCL).
For the Gemma: LED Pin is 1, Accelerometer is 0 (SDA) and 1 (SCL).
